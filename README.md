# Predict-AQI-Linear-Regression-and-Random-Forests

## Project Overview
This project applies data mining techniques to predict carbon monoxide (CO) concentration using the UCI Air Quality dataset. It compares three models:
- **Linear Regression** (Subtopic 1): A linear model for prediction.
- **Decision Tree and Random Forest** (Subtopic 2): Decision Trees split data based on features, while Random Forests use an ensemble of trees for improved accuracy.

The Jupyter Notebook preprocesses the dataset, trains the models, evaluates their performance (MSE and R²), and visualizes the results with scatter plots and a bar chart.

## Requirements
Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment with most required libraries pre-installed. The notebook uses the following Python libraries, which are already available in Colab:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Files in the Repository
- `23105760_linear_regression_decision_trees_and_random_forests.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations for air quality prediction.
- `23105760_aqi_linear_regression_and_random_forests.pdf`: The report for the findingins from the data analysis.
- `AirQualityUCI.csv`: The UCI Air Quality dataset used for training and testing the models (download and upload to Colab).
- `predicted_vs_actual.png`: Scatter plot comparing predicted vs. actual CO(GT) values for Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (generated by the notebook).
- `model_performance.png`: Bar chart comparing MSE and R² scores for all three models (generated by the notebook).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## How to Run Using Google Colab
1. **Upload the Notebook to Colab**:
   - In Google Colab, click **File > Upload Notebook**.
   - Choose `23105760_linear_regression_decision_trees_and_random_forests.ipynb` from your local machine and upload it.
2. **Upload the Dataset to Colab**:
   - In the Colab sidebar, click the **Files** tab (folder icon on the left).
   - Click the **Upload** button (paper with an upward arrow).
   - Select `AirQualityUCI.csv` from your local machine and upload it. It will appear in the `/content` directory in Colab.
   - The notebook expects the dataset to be in the same directory, and the code already uses the correct path (`AirQualityUCI.csv`).
3. **Run the Cells**:
   - The notebook is divided into cells with markdown explanations and code.
   - Run each cell in order by clicking the "Run" button (play icon) or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
   - If prompted to "Run all cells," you can select this option to execute the entire notebook at once.
4. **View Outputs**:
   - The notebook will print the MSE and R² scores for each model.
   - It will generate and display two plots:
     - **Scatter Plot**: Predicted vs. Actual CO(GT) for Linear Regression (blue), Decision Tree (orange), and Random Forest (green).
     - **Bar Chart**: Model Performance Comparison (MSE in orange, R² in purple).
   - The plots are saved as `predicted_vs_actual.png` and `model_performance.png` in Colab’s `/content` directory.
5. **Download the Plots (Optional)**:
   - In the Colab **Files** tab, right-click on `predicted_vs_actual.png` and `model_performance.png`, then select **Download** to save them to your local machine.

## Notes
- The dataset must be uploaded to Colab as described for the code to run without modification.
- The notebook uses `random_state=42` for reproducibility, ensuring consistent results across runs.
- This project is part of a data mining study comparing Linear Regression with Decision Trees and Random Forests, focusing on air quality prediction in Kathmandu.
